      A skew of 1 causes the profile of treatment capacity rates across the number of months waiting to be unchanged from the calibration period.<br><br>A skew of greater than 1 will increase the treatment capacity rate for the longer waiters, and decrease the treatment capacity rate for the shorter waiters.<br><br>A skew of less than 1 will decrease the treatment capacity rate for the longer waiters, and increase the treatment capacity rate for the shorter waiters.<br><br>All skew values leave the treatment capacity rates for individuals waiting less than 1 month unchanged from the treatment capacity rate calculated from the calibration period.
