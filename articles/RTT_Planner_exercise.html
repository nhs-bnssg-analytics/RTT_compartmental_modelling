<p>This exercise helps you understand how the RTT Planner tool works for
forecasting an elective waiting list. The RTT Planner tool is located at
this URL: <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/rtt_compartmental_modelling/" class="external-link uri">https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/rtt_compartmental_modelling/</a></p>
<p>This exercise sheet helps you understand the methods that underpin
the tool.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="whats-going-on-projecting-forward-1">What’s going on –

<p>HERE, THE SAME METHOD IS APPLIED AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED FOR
PROJECTING FORWARD. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE ARE
<strong>ESTIMATING</strong> FUTURE DEMAND AND CAPACITY (COMPARED WITH
WHAT WE DID PREVIOUSLY, WHERE WE PROVIDED OBSERVED DEMAND AND CAPACITY
DATA).</p>
<p>ONE COMPLEXITY IS THAT THE TOOL CREATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FIRST
VALUE IN THE PROJECTED PERIOD FOR REFERRALS AND TREATMENT CAPACITY. THE
WAY IT DOES THIS IS BY PERFORMING A LINEAR REGRESSION ON THE OBSERVED
DATA, AND IF THE MODEL IS SIGNIFICANT (P-VALUE ≤ 0.01), IT WILL USE IT
TO ESTIMATE THE FINAL VALUE IN THE OBSERVED PERIOD AND USE THAT AS THE
FIRST VALUE IN THE PROJECTED PERIOD. IF THE MODEL IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, IT
WILL USE THE MEAN OF THE OBSERVED PERIOD AS THE FIRST VALUE IN THE
PROJECTED PERIOD.</p>

PERFORMANCE IS BETTER.</p>
<p>THE SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCE DETERIORATES BECAUSE REFERRALS ARE LOWER,

MONTHS</strong>, CAUSING THE PERFORMANCE METRIC (PROPORTION OF WAITING
LIST WAITING LESS THAN 18 WEEKS) TO APPEAR TO DETERIORATE.</p>

<p>The scenario planner described above can support medium-term
planning. It will often be the case that the results of the optimiser
will be out of balance, e.g., the arrivals (referrals) will not be equal
to the departures (treatments plus reneges). As a result, an extension
of this scenario will likely result in a growing or shrinking waiting
list, and a corresponding change of performance.</p>
<p>The steady state tab helpfully models a scenario where the
<strong>arrivals are in balance with the departures</strong> AND
<strong>a set performance target is achieved</strong>. This situation
can be met with multiple configurations of how treatment is allocated
along with different quantities of reneging. The final constraints this
page provides is to fix the overall renege rates (as a proportion of
departures) to either a recently observed renege rate value or a user
defined value. It also aims to minimise the difference in how treatment
is proportionally applied across the waiting list compared with how is
has recently been applied across the waiting list.</p>
